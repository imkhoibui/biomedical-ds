<h3> Sections covered: </h3>

<strong>1. Inference </strong> <br>
This section covers the foundational terms related to biomedical data science. <br>
I ponder upon the learned concepts from my MATH205 - Probability course, and I 
attempt to revisit them in this section.

the intuition behind statistical tests?...

Those are the questions that should be found within this section.

<strong> 2. Exploratory Data Analysis </strong>

<strong> 3. Robust Statistics </strong>
