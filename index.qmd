Hi there!
My name is Khoi, I am currently a senior student (about to graduate!) at Fulbright University Vietnam.

I major in Computer Science, with a minor in Integrated Science. During my time here, I have discovered my joy
of working with biomedical data. I am self-learning a lot in my free time and what you are seeing here is a prime
example of one.

This website is a notebook for my learning of the course "Biomedical Data Science" provided by MIT OpenCoursework.

The original access to the webpage can be found here.

I do not own any of the information provided by them, yet I tried to adapt some of the materials into my own
learning. If there's any violation of the materials or I am using any information not owned by me, you are welcome
to reach out to me.

Thank you for reading, I hope you'd found something useful!
