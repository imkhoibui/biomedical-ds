    "text": "Hi there! My name is Khoi, I am currently a senior student (about to graduate!) at Fulbright University Vietnam.\nI major in Computer Science, with a minor in Integrated Science. During my time here, I have discovered my joy of working with biomedical data. I am self-learning a lot in my free time and what you are seeing here is a prime example of one.\nThis website is a notebook for my learning of the course “Biomedical Data Science” provided by MIT OpenCoursework.\nThe original access to the webpage can be found here.\nI do not own any of the information provided by them, yet I tried to adapt some of the materials into my own learning. If there’s any violation of the materials or I am using any information not owned by me, you are welcome to reach out to me.\nThank you for reading, I hope you’d found something useful!"
