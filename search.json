Say you have data of patients’ ages who visited the Cho Ray hospital in 2023, what can you say/describe in an overall fashion about the data? One such way is to use a CDF (cumulative distribution function).\nLet’s start with a height example (because sadly I don’t have the data from Cho Ray hospital).\n\nround(sample(x, 10), 1)\n\n [1] 64.8 70.5 65.7 63.7 64.7 68.8 62.7 63.6 64.5 66.3\n\nsmallest &lt;- floor(min(x))\nlargest &lt;- ceiling(max(x))\nvalues &lt;- seq(smallest, largest, len=300)\nheightecdf &lt;- ecdf(x)\nplot(values, heightecdf(values), type=\"l\",\n    xlab=\"a (Height in inches)\", ylab=\"Pr(x &lt;= a)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability function explains that, “we start out with 0 example and 0 CDF, as the number of examples increase, the number of CDF also increase but you can kinda tell where most of the data lies within those examples”.\nSo for this data, no one was observed under ~58 inches, but there are a few at the height increases, and no further observation is greater than ~77 inches.\nHistogram is another great way to illustrate the data:\n\nbins &lt;- seq(smallest, largest)\nhist(x, breaks = bins, xlab = \"Height (in inches)\", main = \"Adult heights\")",
